Description: This is the readme document pertaining to running our 
experiments. It comprises 8 files:

1. getStateLevelData.py
This function runs the final experiment code across each debate event and
state, to extract sentiments/preferred candidate/key themes at a event-state
level.

2. cleanTopicExtraction.R
This function extracts coefficients of the LDA used in our topic extraction,
and maps the key words to specific themes (ie foreign policy/racial issues).
